Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string "".

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
Output: "ada"
Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
Output: "racecar"
Explanation: The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".
Example 3:

Input: words = ["def","ghi"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.



```csharp

public class Solution {
    public string FirstPalindrome(string[] words) {
        if (words == null) return null;
        foreach(var i in words)
        {
            string s="";
            for(int j=i.Length-1;j>=0;j--)
            {
                s+=i[j];           
            }
            if(s==i)
            {
                return s;
            }  
        }
        return "";
    }
}
